Swarbrick et al.2019,Neuronal Pentraxin 2 predicts medial temporal atrophy and memory decline across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum,Brain Imaging and Behavior,Human,AD,,NPTX2 levels were found to be predictive of medial temporal atrophy and memory decline in Alzheimer's disease.
Xiao et al.2017,NPTX2 and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease,eLife,Human,AD,,"Study found lower levels of NPTX2 in cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's patients, which correlated with cognitive impairment."
Chen et al.2019,NPTX2 is an important player in the hippocampal synaptic dysfunction of APP/PS1 mice,Journal of Neurochemistry,Animal (Mouse),AD,,"NPTX2 was found to be significantly decreased in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease, and its overexpression improved synaptic function."
