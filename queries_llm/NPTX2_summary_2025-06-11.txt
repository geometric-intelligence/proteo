NPTX2 has been explicitly linked to various forms of dementia in humans, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Studies have shown that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of NPTX2 can predict the progression from normal cognition to AD, indicating its potential as a biomarker for early detection of the disease (Soldan et al., 2023). Furthermore, synaptic dysfunction, a key pathophysiology in dementia, has been associated with altered levels of NPTX2 in the CSF, suggesting its involvement in synaptic mechanisms underlying cognitive decline (Nilsson et al., 2024). In genetic forms of FTD, NPTX2 has been identified as a synapse-derived CSF biomarker, supporting its role in the synaptic pathology observed in this type of dementia (van der Ende et al., 2020).

In animal models, NPTX2 has been linked to Alzheimer's disease. A study demonstrated that NPTX2 transfection improved synaptic excitatory/inhibitory balance and performance in learning tasks in a mouse model of AD, suggesting that NPTX2 plays a protective role against AD-related synaptic dysfunction (Severin et al., 2025). However, there is no explicit mention of NPTX2 being linked to other types of dementia in animal models within the provided papers.

NPTX2 has also been associated with other neuropathologies in humans. For instance, it has been implicated in synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD), as alterations in CSF biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction, including NPTX2, have been observed in PD patients (Nilsson et al., 2023). This indicates that NPTX2 may play a role in the synaptic alterations contributing to the pathophysiology of PD.

In animal models, NPTX2 has been linked to neuropathologies such as epilepsy. Inhibition of NPTX2 was found to relieve epileptic seizures in a mouse model by reducing GluA1-dependent excitatory postsynaptic currents, highlighting its involvement in the synaptic alterations associated with epilepsy (Xing et al., 2024).

In conclusion, NPTX2 is linked to dementia, including AD and FTD, in humans and to AD in animal models. It is also associated with other neuropathologies such as PD in humans and epilepsy in animal models. These findings underscore the importance of NPTX2 in synaptic function and its potential as a biomarker for various neurological conditions.
